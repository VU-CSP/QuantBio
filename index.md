IGP 8002-03 Bioregulation II (2023S)
=====  

## Systems Pharmacology
-----  
This section of the IGP Bioregulation II course will have a combination of lectures and interactive activities exposing students to:  

1) Digital image analysis, especially of live-cell microscopy.  
2) Assessment of cell population dynamics and single-cell responses.  
3) Consideration of concentration-dependent responses to chemical perturbations.  

Together these comprise an example of **Systems Pharmacology**.  

_At the end of this 6-week section, you will be able to:_ 

* Recognize several digital image file formats.  
* Be familiar with software tools capable of reading and analyzing digital images.  
* Perform basic image manipulation and segmentation and extract quantitative information from digital images.  
* Understand population growth models and how to fit them to experimental data
* Know how to fit dose–response models to experimental data and interpret dose–response curves.  
* Appreciate systems-level analyses of pharmacological responses.  

There will be assignments (due before the next class period) that will require you to use computational tools to analyze data and answer questions about your results.
