## Adding Markdown to notebooks
### Annotation in Jupyter and Google Colaboratory (Colab) Notebooks
Notebooks are specifically structured files that embed code and annotations within the same document and that can be rendered for easy viewing in web browsers.  

Notebook filenames typically end with the extension `.ipynb` (for iPython Notebook).  

This extensions is important for automatic rendering, such as within Git repositories hosted on GitHub. See the [original announcement of notebook rendering on GitHub](https://blog.jupyter.org/rendering-notebooks-on-github-f7ac8736d686).    

For more details on the types of things you can do with markup within notebooks, see [documentation for markdown cells](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html)  

-----  

In **Jupyter Notebooks**, selecting Markdown or Code cells looks like this:  

<img src="/static_files/presentations/img/Jupyter_blocks_unexecuted.png" style="width: 400px;" />  

and once they have been executed, they look like this:  

<img src="/static_files/presentations/img/Jupyter_blocks_executed.png" style="width: 400px;" />  

-----  

In **Google Colab Notebooks**, selecting Markdown or Code cells looks like this:  

<img src="/static_files/presentations/img/Colab_blocks_unexecuted.png" style="width: 400px;" />

and once they have been executed, they look like this:  

<img src="/static_files/presentations/img/Colab_blocks_executed.png" style="width: 400px;" />
